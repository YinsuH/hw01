# hw01

## This is an autobiography from Yinsu Han for HW01.
My name is **Yinsu Han**. I am a rising sophomore in the college, planning to major in **mathematics**. I am always excited to learn new things. Here are several things I enjoy apart from learning:

* *Playing basketball*
* *Listening to music/Going to concerts*
* *Hanging out with my friends*

### This is a picture of mine in downtown Chicago

#### This is includes the reference information to finish HW01.
To complete the assignment, I first watched the video demonstration from https://cfss.uchicago.edu/homework/edit-readme/ and I find it really helpful to get the overall idea. Next, I referenced the mastering-markdown website(https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) from github to know the basic syntax required to complete this homework.
